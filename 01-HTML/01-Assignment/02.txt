Purpose of Comments in HTML:

            Comments in HTML serve the purpose of providing additional information within the code for developers or anyone reading the HTML document. 
            HTML comments are not rendered in the browser, so they are not visible to users. 
            They are purely for documentation and communication among developers.    

        Example of Using Comments in HTML:
             <!DOCTYPE html>
                <html lang="en">
                <head>
                    <meta charset="UTF-8">
                    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
                    <title>HTML Comments Example</title>
                    </head>
                <body>

                    <!-- This is a comment in HTML -->
                    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>

                    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>

                    <!--
                        This is a multiline comment
                        that provides additional details
                        about the structure of the document.
                    -->

                </body>
                </html>
