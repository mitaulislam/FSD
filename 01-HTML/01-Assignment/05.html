<!-- The Document Type Declaration, commonly known as the DOCTYPE declaration or DOCTYPE,-
        -is a declaration at the beginning of an HTML document that specifies the version of HTML or XML in use. 
         It helps browsers to interpret and render the document correctly.

        Purpose of the DOCTYPE Declaration:
        1.Version Information:
             It informs the web browser about the HTML or XML version in use.
        2.Rendering Mode:
             It determines the rendering mode used by the browser (quirks mode, strict mode, or almost standards mode).     

       Example : -->
         <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <title>HTML Document with DOCTYPE Declaration</title>
        </head>
        <body>

            <h1>This is an HTML Document</h1>
            <p>Example content goes here.</p>

        </body>
        </html>
